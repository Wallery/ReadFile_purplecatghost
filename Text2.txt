[Private Conversation Between Frozen 2 & SodaGod]

Frozen 2: 
Tommy

Frozen 2:

Frozen 2: 
i know you're mad but are you pissed

Frozen 2: 
youre not answering me in real life or in text 
so im gonna take that as a yes

SodaGod: 
I'm not pissed

Frozen 2: 
youre not supposed to text and drive

SodaGod: 
Stop texting me then!

Frozen 2: 
but then i cant talk to you

SodaGod: 
What a shame that would be

Frozen 2: 
oh god

Frozen 2: 
youre using sarcasm

SodaGod: 
I can use sarcasm!

SodaGod: 
Why is that a surprise??

Frozen 2: 
bc it means youre pissed

Frozen 2:

SodaGod: 
I'm really trying to drive Frozen!

SodaGod: 
I can't do that if you're distracting me!

Frozen 2:

SodaGod: 
Not right now I'm trying to drive

Frozen 2:

SodaGod: 
Not if I'm gonna be yelling!

Frozen 2: 
so you ARE pissed

Frozen 2: 
damn i knew it

Frozen 2: 
never a good sign when you make me sit in the back

SodaGod: 
It was so you could lay down

SodaGod: 
You're still bleeding

SodaGod: 
...And also so I wouldn't get road rage

Frozen 2: 
knew itttt

Frozen 2: 
talk to me

SodaGod: 
I am

Frozen 2: 
you know what i mean


   Tommy glances at the message on his phone and lets out a huff before returning his eyes to the road.

   \"I know you saw it.\" Forzen calls to him. Tommy refuses to react in any way shape or form. Instead, his eyes remain glued to the road ahead of them. \"Stop ignoring me, I know you can hear me.\"

   \"Not right now, Forzen.\" Tommy mumbles, then immediately bites his tongue. He shouldn't have responded. That's only going to encourage Forzen and Tommy already has enough to deal with.

   Tommy glances at all the cars nearby him, specifically checking their drivers. None of the cars have tinted windows- a good sign. Most of the drivers around him right now don't immediately set off any alarms- another good sign.

   His shoulders roll and try to relax. He glances in the rear view mirror, looking over Forzen again before checking himself. Everything looks normal- Tommy looks perfectly normal- but he can't be too careful. Tommy can never be too careful these days. Not with everything on the line, not with everything he needs to keep track of- not after everything everything everything-

   Tommy's phone lights up again. He glances at it, catching a hint of the message.

Frozen 2:
you look tense

   It takes everything in him not to make another sarcastic response. Of course I'm tense, I gave you one specific instruction and you went against it anyways. On my day off too- you know how many of these I get a year, Forzen, and you took one of the few ones I have away from me.

   Another text pops up.

Frozen 2: 
deep breath

   Tommy sucks in a breath, doing so with an irritated look on his face. He hates that Forzen can read him right now. Usually Tommy is good about it but his emotions are raw and unfiltered right now. There's no concealing it.

Frozen 2: 
cant we talk

   With one hand, Tommy reaches over and quickly types in a response, all while keeping a steady eye on the road. Forzen is lucky Tommy's gotten good at multitasking. He wouldn't have lasted this long without it.

SodaGod: 
Stop texting me I need to focus

   To Tommy's surprise, no new messages seem to come after that. His eyes do another quick sweep of everything- eyes on the road, check the cars and their drivers, check Forzen and his wounds, check yourself and your posture, deep breaths, stay calm, stay collected, and above all act natural. Though for a moment, he notes that Forzen seems to still be texting, even if Tommy gets no new texts.

   Minutes pass by. Tommy's starting to think he's in the clear when his phone lights up again. He's almost frustrated until he stares at the new number in confusion. Then he's thrown in for a loop when he reads the message and mentally suppresses his urge to slam his foot down on the break.

   \"Did you tattle on me?\" Tommy finally turns his head to look at Forzen for a brief moment, sending a look as he does. He can hardly believe it. \"You- you tattled on me to the soda parlor worker?\"

   \"You weren't talking to me.\" Forzen says, like that explains everything.

   Tommy honestly wants to bang his head against the horn of the car and let it ring out in frustration. Unfortunately, he can't do that because he's on the highway and would really rather avoid a crash. That's the last thing they need right now.

   \"Okay- fine! We're- we're talking!\"

   \"You're stressed.\"

   \"Great observation.\"

   \"Tommy.\"

   That makes him stop. Because Forzen is looking at the rear view mirror and he sounds genuine and softer than before. \"I'm sorry.\"

   He knows, at least. That he owes Tommy an apology. Hearing it outloud feels nice. A pound taken away from the load on his chest. Tommy can breath just a little easier and finds his words leave him easier too.

   \"I told you not to go there. I gave you one thing to do and- and it was just to not do something. One thing! I- I didn't think it would be that hard to follow!\"

   \"I'm sorry.\" Forzen repeats. \"I wasn't thinking and I didn't mean for this to happen.\" He's making it hard to get mad at him with that look on his face.

   \"I- I need you to understand that it's not because you went against my wishes or- or because you're making me work on my day off. You got hurt, Forzen. I'm- I'm mad because you got hurt and you scared me. I don't like it when you get hurt!\"

   \"I know.\" Forzen's voice is quieter now, guilty. \"I'm sorry.\"

   It's so easy to let it go. Tommy breathes out and one of the knots in his chest is gone. \"I forgive you.\" Tommy always tries make that as clear as possible after a fight with Forzen. Otherwise he usually doesn't get the message and assumes Tommy is still mad, even weeks after the fight. \"Justâ€¦ Please don't do that again?\"

   Forzen nods. Tommy does another sweep- road, cars and drivers, Forzen, yourself, stay calm- before his eyes linger to the phone sitting on his stand. He pauses before reaching over to it.

PotionsMan:

PotionsMan:

worried and I kinda offered without thinking?

SodaGod:

PotionsMan:

PotionsMan:

PotionsMan:

 you know where I work!

SodaGod: 
I'll keep that in mind!
