SodaGod: 
You're not like... In a dangerous situation right now and the 
only way you can get out is by talking to Tommy right?

Frozen 2:

to have guessed that exactly situation

Frozen 2:

heya Tommy

SodaGod: 
Forzen

SodaGod: 
You panic texted a cute worker at a soda parlor for the last half hour 
and have a long history of avoiding the issue so I'm starting to think 
we really don't have time for small talk?

Frozen 2: 
never saw his face but he cute?

SodaGod: 
Forzen this really isn't the time!

SodaGod: 
What did you do?

Frozen 2:

SodaGod: 
Oh my fucking god
