For Windows:
  Save TommyProblem.exe and Text.txt on your computer in the same place and run the exe file
  
For Other:
  Use an online c compiler and compile 
  ex: https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler
  and import TommyProblem_easy.c and Text.txt
  Then compile
  
  Should work, but not optimal
